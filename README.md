# Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

# Project Overview
This project implements a complete machine learning pipeline for cardiovascular disease prediction using patient medical data. The assignment demonstrates practical application of classification algorithms in healthcare data science.

# Objectives
Analyze real-world medical dataset for heart disease prediction

Implement data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis

Build and evaluate multiple classification models

Compare traditional and ensemble learning techniques

Perform hyperparameter tuning for optimized performance

# Dataset Information
Mendeley Cardiovascular Disease Dataset
Target Variable: Presence or absence of cardiovascular disease (Binary Classification)
Features Include:

Age, Gender

Blood pressure measurements

Cholesterol levels

Glucose levels

Electrocardiographic results

Exercise-induced angina

ST depression measurements

Number of major vessels

# Key Findings
Random Forest achieved the highest performance across all metrics

Recall is emphasized due to medical implications (minimizing false negatives)

Feature importance analysis identified key predictors of heart disease

Proper scaling significantly improved Logistic Regression performance
